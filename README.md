ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Saeed, an enthusiastic Information Systems graduate passionate about technology and problem-solving. Completed an internship as a Full Stack Developer at Dojo, I'm sharpening my skills in React Native and Node.js to craft captivating mobile applications.

Beyond my internship, I've recently completed two intensive courses: one focused on Data Analysis, where I gained proficiency in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools, and another in QA Automation, equipping me with expertise in Selenium and test automation frameworks.

I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy tackling challenges head-on. I'm dedicated to continuous learning and growth as an aspiring tech professional. Let's connect and explore opportunities to innovate together!
